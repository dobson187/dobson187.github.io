### Genetic and epigenetic regulatory variation in humans

### Mapping of variation in NFKabbaB and Pol II loci across humans
Hap-cells

Observe variation that correlates with gene expression

### Map chromatin marks across individuals

Observed many difference

* Histones (especially at enhancers)
* Some "population-preference" marks

#### ChromHMM across 19 ind. -> 15 "states"

### "Active enhancer" state varies the most across individuals

### Did not observe switching from enhancer state to promoter state; however, do see switching from active to inactive and vice versa

### Chromatin marks are highly heritable

#### Underly transcription factor differences that correlate with these epigenetic differences (correlation - not proof)

#### Multiple enhancers changed = change
#### One of multiple enhancers changed = no change

### Also observed protein variation across individuals as well (modest 5.7% vary 1.5-fold or more)

## Order of magnitude more SNps in regulatory regions than nsSNVs in coding regions

### Spent a lot of time talking about super deep sequencing of his own genome

### Mouse tissues closer to other mouse tissues // Same for human || by expression {PCA}
