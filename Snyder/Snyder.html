<h3>Genetic and epigenetic regulatory variation in humans</h3>

<h3>Mapping of variation in NFKabbaB and Pol II loci across humans</h3>

<p>Hap-cells</p>

<p>Observe variation that correlates with gene expression</p>

<h3>Map chromatin marks across individuals</h3>

<p>Observed many difference</p>

<ul>
<li>Histones (especially at enhancers)</li>
<li>Some "population-preference" marks</li>
</ul>

<h4>ChromHMM across 19 ind. -> 15 "states"</h4>

<h3>"Active enhancer" state varies the most across individuals</h3>

<h3>Did not observe switching from enhancer state to promoter state; however, do see switching from active to inactive and vice versa</h3>

<h3>Chromatin marks are highly heritable</h3>

<h4>Underly transcription factor differences that correlate with these epigenetic differences (correlation - not proof)</h4>

<h4>Multiple enhancers changed = change</h4>

<h4>One of multiple enhancers changed = no change</h4>

<h3>Also observed protein variation across individuals as well (modest 5.7% vary 1.5-fold or more)</h3>

<h2>Order of magnitude more SNps in regulatory regions than nsSNVs in coding regions</h2>

<h3>Spent a lot of time talking about super deep sequencing of his own genome</h3>

<h3>Mouse tissues closer to other mouse tissues // Same for human || by expression {PCA}</h3>
