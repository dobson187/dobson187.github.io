<h3>Targeting Chromatin for Therapy (rebooting the epigenome)</h3>

<h3>Relationships between DNA methylation of enhancers, gene body, and promoters on gene expression</h3>

<h3>CpG Islands</h3>

<h4>Two cell lines (HCT116) and derivative with 95% DNA-meth removed (DKO1)</h4>

<h4>DKO1 loss of methylation results in</h4>

<ul>
<li>H2A.Z</li>
<li>H3K4me3</li>
<li>H3K4me1</li>
<li>H3K27me3</li>
<li>Gene expression changes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Set of rules:</h3>

<ul>
<li>K4me3 - only at TSS (permissive)</li>
<li>K4me3  - Never at meCpG</li>
<li>K9ac - Active TSS</li>
<li>H2A.Z - never at meCpG or at non-CpG islands</li>
<li>K27me3 - Regulates PcG (CpG islands)</li>
<li>K27me3 - Counter distributed with meCpG</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other important rule</h3>

<ul>
<li>meCpG at promoters = silenced</li>
<li>meCpG at gene bodies = expressed</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ileal Neobladder - in response to BLCA</h3>

<h4>Piece of small intestine is made into artificial bladder (connect kidneys to urethra)</h4>

<h4>Gut to urinary environment</h4>

<h4>DNA methylation changes in the neobladder is time dependent and faster than aging (expected)</h4>

<h4>Changes are in 50% of enhancers and transcribed regions</h4>

<h4>Each neobladder adopts a unique epigenome (multiple component analyses) - different than blood, bladder and small intestine</h4>

<p>Hypothesizes that this may be related to pH-dependent reprogramming (beer pee joke)</p>

<h3>Gene reactivation following 5-aza requires insertion of H2A.Z</h3>

<h4>After a few weeks DNMTs come back and re-silence the genes</h4>

<h4>After initial burst of growth effect and demethylation the methylation comes back and growth goes back to normal</h4>

<h5>Different rates of re-methylation</h5>

<h5>Gene bodies are overrepresented in fast rebounders</h5>

<h5>Inhibition of gene body methylation => gene expression goes down</h5>

<h5>Genes are upregulated in cancer w/o respect to gene body DNA methylation</h5>

<h5>Rapid rebound requires DNMT3B - of both methylation and gene expression</h5>

<h3>Proposes that we are "blunting" the effects of c-MYC upregulation of target genes by removing gene body meCpG</h3>
