### Targeting Chromatin for Therapy (rebooting the epigenome)

#### Reviews Jones, 2012 [Figure shown]

### Relationships between DNA methylation of enhancers, gene body, and promoters on gene expression

### CpG Islands

#### Two cell lines (HCT116) and derivative with 95% DNA-meth removed (DKO1)

#### DKO1 loss of methylation results in

* H2A.Z
* H3K4me3
* H3K4me1
* H3K27me3
* Gene expression changes

### Set of rules:

* K4me3 - only at TSS (permissive)
* K4me3  - Never at meCpG
* K9ac - Active TSS
* H2A.Z - never at meCpG or at non-CpG islands
* K27me3 - Regulates PcG (CpG islands)
* K27me3 - Counter distributed with meCpG

### Other important rule

* meCpG at promoters = silenced
* meCpG at gene bodies = expressed

### Ileal Neobladder - in response to BLCA
#### Piece of small intestine is made into artificial bladder (connect kidneys to urethra)
#### Gut to urinary environment

#### DNA methylation changes in the neobladder is time dependent and faster than aging (expected)

#### Changes are in 50% of enhancers and transcribed regions

#### Each neobladder adopts a unique epigenome (multiple component analyses) - different than blood, bladder and small intestine

Hypothesizes that this may be related to pH-dependent reprogramming (beer pee joke)

### Gene reactivation following 5-aza requires insertion of H2A.Z

#### After a few weeks DNMTs come back and re-silence the genes

#### After initial burst of growth effect and demethylation the methylation comes back and growth goes back to normal

##### Different rates of re-methylation

##### Gene bodies are overrepresented in fast rebounders

##### Inhibition of gene body methylation => gene expression goes down

##### Genes are upregulated in cancer w/o respect to gene body DNA methylation

##### Rapid rebound requires DNMT3B - of both methylation and gene expression

### Proposes that we are "blunting" the effects of c-MYC upregulation of target genes by removing gene body meCpG
