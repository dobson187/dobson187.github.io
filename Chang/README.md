# lncRNAs and enhancers

# Relationships between structure and function for RNA molecules

## HOTTIP controls activation of locus through 3D-chromosome structure
### Suggest that HOTTIP provides interface between chromatin state and architecture

# NEST => lncRNA confers susceptibility to infection
## Interacts with MLLs to promote H3K4me3 and activation of IFN-g expression

# WDR5: adapter protein for multiple inputs (RpBP5, MLL1, Dppy30, Ash2L, NEST)
## Used crystal structure to mutate all charged residues to alanine (systematic mutational analysis)
### Found RNA-binding pocket in WDR5
#### Found one mutant that only affects RNA-binding => not assembly of the rest of the complex
#### This mutation can not properly activate target genes
### Made an inducible replacement system in mouse (can replace WT WDR5 w/mutatnt in a temporally-defined manner)
#### ESCs are unable to maintain H3K4me3
### Did a screen (tandem-IP contruct) to identify other RNAs that can bind to WT WDR5 and not MT-WDR5
#### 223 ncRNA, 1181 mRNAs, 17 miRNA, 13 snoRNA
#### Some of these RNAs are important for maintenance of ESC pluripotency

# Going in the other direction => mapping RNA structure to function
## Parallel Analysis of RNA Structure (PARS)
### RNAse V1 library => dsRNA cutting   =>   deep sequencing
### RNAse S1 library => ssRNA cutting   =>   deep sequencing
### Provides a single nucleotide resolution map of RNA structure
#### secondary structure of mRNAs
##### 5' CDS loop
##### 3 nucleotide periodicity within CDS
### Genomic crossing to look at SNVs effects on RNA shape/structure (maternal/paternal contributions) [RiboSNitch]
### RNA structure is different at splice cites
### RNA structure is different at true miRNA target sites
### RiboSNitches obey systematic rules
#### Base composition and location at center versus boundary of RSS matter

## Can evolution allow us to understand which structural variants are more important and therefore "functional"?
### Yes => 3'-UTR, miRNA, and known sites for RNA-binding proteins (not so much lncRNA sequences)

# Recently developed a chemical to do this in cell lines (hESCs)
