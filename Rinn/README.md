# Rinn

# Single cell RNA-sequencing during differentiation
##### Fluidics devide that traps a single cell
##### Problem of abundance

## Used myogenesis as a model system
### Captured ~100 cells per timepoint in the fluid device => use a microscope to count # of cells
#### NextEra tech to make library right in device

## Proposes that many cells are "out of order" "Monocole"
1. Orders cells by progress though a biological process
2. Classifies cells according to type
3. Finds differentially expressed genes (unsupervised)
## Iterative component analysis
### Reduce dimensionality
### Minimal spanning tree - lowest number of lines to connect dots
