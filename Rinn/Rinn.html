<h1>Rinn</h1>

<h1>Single cell RNA-sequencing during differentiation</h1>

<h5>Fluidics devide that traps a single cell</h5>

<h5>Problem of abundance</h5>

<h2>Used myogenesis as a model system</h2>

<h3>Captured ~100 cells per timepoint in the fluid device => use a microscope to count # of cells</h3>

<h4>NextEra tech to make library right in device</h4>

<h2>Proposes that many cells are "out of order" "Monocole"</h2>

<ol>
<li>Orders cells by progress though a biological process</li>
<li>Classifies cells according to type</li>
<li>Finds differentially expressed genes (unsupervised)
<h2>Iterative component analysis</h2></li>
</ol>

<h3>Reduce dimensionality</h3>

<h3>Minimal spanning tree - lowest number of lines to connect dots</h3>
