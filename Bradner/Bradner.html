<h1>Bradner Q1: 0101</h1>

<h3>Chemical modulation of chromatin structure and function</h3>

<p>Describes cancer as a disease of human enhancers</p>

<p>c-MYC preferentially occupies superenhancers</p>

<ul>
<li>invades new enhancers</li>
<li>recruits elongation factors</li>
</ul>

<p>One such factor is BRD4, which can be inhibited by their novel small molecule
JQ1</p>

<p>Superenhancers are not only read at highly expressed genes but at all genes</p>

<p>JQ1 inhibits pol II progression through gene bodies</p>

<h3>Gave a TED talk - worth looking up</h3>

<h3>Brander's view is to do <em>in vivo</em> expts. first to get figs 1 &amp; 5</h3>
