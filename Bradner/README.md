# Bradner Q1: 0101

### Chemical modulation of chromatin structure and function

Describes cancer as a disease of human enhancers

c-MYC preferentially occupies superenhancers

* invades new enhancers
* recruits elongation factors

One such factor is BRD4, which can be inhibited by their novel small molecule
JQ1

Superenhancers are not only read at highly expressed genes but at all genes

JQ1 inhibits pol II progression through gene bodies

### Gave a TED talk - worth looking up

### Brander's view is to do *in vivo* expts. first to get figs 1 & 5
