# Fuller Q2: 0204

# Cell type specific transcriptional repression programs proper differentiation in an adult stem cell lineage

## Adult stem cells responsible for regeneration of multiple tissue types

## Spermatogenesis in drosophila is a model of adult stem cell lineage

### Asymetric division -> proliferation -> spermatocytes -> terminal differentiation

#### Special G2 stage where >1000 genes are turned on (pre-meitoic)

#### tTAF   =>  Testis-specific components of TFIID are expressed

#### tMAC   =>  spermatocyte specific form of (MIP/DREAM) complex

##### Mechanism =>

* Precursors have:
    * K27me3
    * no k4me3
    * no p2
* Then genes are switched:
    * Get pol II
    * paused
* Pol II gets activated at terminal differentiation

## Switch from pre-cursors to terminal diff is both activation of proper lineage genes and concomittant repression of other diff. program genes

### tZnF is a 6 C2H2 znf only expressed in testis
#### KO results in meiotic arrest and absence of terminal differentiation
#### Functions as a repressor - KO has activation of many genes that should never be on in testis - mostly neural genes

## Hypothesis: tZnF represses somatic gene expression to prevent collateral damage gene expression upon loss of MMB (DREAM) function in differentiating cells
### Showed that somatic genes require tZnF to be repressed in testis (normally repressed by DREAM) and require tMAC for this repressive function
#### Also showed at transcriptome level

## Question: what is the motif?
### A: not known => hypothesize that it acts like REST (acts in non-neuronal tissues to repress neuronal genes)
