### Transcription protects CpG island promoters from DNA methylation independently of Histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation

### CpG island promoters: islands of protection

Rarely methylated - even though they appear biochemically to be strong targets/substrates

#### Presence of me on H3K4 prevents DNMTs from binding and methylating DNA

### R-loops 

* 3-stranded structure with an RNA:DNA hybrid and a single DNA strand

* Co-transcriptional

* Can be long 0.5-1Kb

* Very stable

* Can be predicted by GC-skew

#### Human CpG islands have a strong GC-skew

Especially at TSS - Ginno et al Gen Res 2013

##### Conserved in vertebrates - not other metazoa unless organism has homolog of DNMT and have global DNA methylation

#### DRIP can recognize and map R-loops

#### R-loop formation is very prevelant at CGI promoters

#### CFP1 has a CXXC that binds CpG island DNA and in a complex with SET1

##### CFP1 -/- show sharply reduced promoter H3K4me3

##### Somehow gene expression isn't changed [odd]

##### Genome was hypomethylated

##### But CGI promoters still protected

#### Inhibit TxN => R-loops disappear rapidly => mut. cells gain high CpGme

#### Genes that are re-methylated were highly expressed
