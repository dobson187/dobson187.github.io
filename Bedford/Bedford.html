<p>Different types of arginine methylation => generally associated with activation</p>

<p>There are 9 PRMTs</p>

<p>Modification at "tips" of histone tails are important</p>

<p>One mark can block MLL from methylating K4</p>

<p>CARM1 enhances nuclear hormone activity</p>

<h3>What do CARM1 and PRMT1 methylate and how do they regulate transcription?</h3>

<h4>Identifying readers of histone marks using an array</h4>

<p>Reading the "histone code" EMBO reports, 2006</p>

<h4>TDRD3 is the fiirst Rme2a effector molecule</h4>

<p>Molecular Cell, 2010</p>

<p>Tudor domain</p>

<p>Binds H4R3me2a - not H4R3me2s</p>

<p>CARM1 is required for TDRD3 recruitment to EREs</p>

<h4>TAP-tagged and purifued complex - found TOP3B</h4>

<p>Can Co-IP</p>

<p>Co-sediment as well (glycerol gradient fractionation)</p>

<h5>They are tightly-paired</h5>

<h5>Iteration is through the n-Terminal tail (not Tudor domain)</h5>

<h4>TDRD3 does not interact with Top3A</h4>

<h4>TDRD3 stabilized Top3B</h4>

<p>KD with siRNA causes Top3B to degrade (can be rescued by OeX)</p>

<h4>Tudor domain is required for TDRD3 and Top3B to go to chromatin</h4>

<h3>The model: Co-activators methylate R on histone tails, then TDRD3/Top3B come to activate genes through alleviation of negative supercoiling</h3>

<h3>c-MYC is a major target of TDRD3</h3>

<h4>TDRD3 is recruited to the c-MYC locus by PRMT1 activity</h4>

<h4>Observed increased R-loops at the c-MYC locus with TDRD3 kd</h4>

<h4>Increased R-loops at the c-Myc locus with PRMT1 loss</h4>

<h3>Generated a KO mouse</h3>

<h4>Increased R-loops at MYC locus in B cells</h4>

<h4>Increased DNA damage</h4>

<h4>Increased c-MYC/IgH translocations</h4>

<h5>AID-dependant</h5>

<h2>Identifying small molecules that can prevent Rme-recognition/interactions</h2>

<h3>UNC1215 (Nat. Chem. Bio.)</h3>

<h4>Strong interactions with MRG15, PHF, SPF</h4>

<h4>Competes with peptide to recognize Rme</h4>

<h4>Now redesigned array and are looking at modified analogs of UNC1215</h4>
