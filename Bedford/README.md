Different types of arginine methylation => generally associated with activation

There are 9 PRMTs

Modification at "tips" of histone tails are important

One mark can block MLL from methylating K4

CARM1 enhances nuclear hormone activity

### What do CARM1 and PRMT1 methylate and how do they regulate transcription?

#### Identifying readers of histone marks using an array

Reading the "histone code" EMBO reports, 2006

#### TDRD3 is the fiirst Rme2a effector molecule

Molecular Cell, 2010

Tudor domain

Binds H4R3me2a - not H4R3me2s

CARM1 is required for TDRD3 recruitment to EREs

#### TAP-tagged and purifued complex - found TOP3B

Can Co-IP

Co-sediment as well (glycerol gradient fractionation)

##### They are tightly-paired

##### Iteration is through the n-Terminal tail (not Tudor domain)

#### TDRD3 does not interact with Top3A

#### TDRD3 stabilized Top3B

KD with siRNA causes Top3B to degrade (can be rescued by OeX)

#### Tudor domain is required for TDRD3 and Top3B to go to chromatin

### The model: Co-activators methylate R on histone tails, then TDRD3/Top3B come to activate genes through alleviation of negative supercoiling

### c-MYC is a major target of TDRD3

#### TDRD3 is recruited to the c-MYC locus by PRMT1 activity

#### Observed increased R-loops at the c-MYC locus with TDRD3 kd

#### Increased R-loops at the c-Myc locus with PRMT1 loss

### Generated a KO mouse

#### Increased R-loops at MYC locus in B cells

#### Increased DNA damage

#### Increased c-MYC/IgH translocations

##### AID-dependant

## Identifying small molecules that can prevent Rme-recognition/interactions

### UNC1215 (Nat. Chem. Bio.)

#### Strong interactions with MRG15, PHF, SPF

#### Competes with peptide to recognize Rme

#### Now redesigned array and are looking at modified analogs of UNC1215
