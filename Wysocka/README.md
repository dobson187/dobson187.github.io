# Wysocka Q@: 0203

# Enhancers are most dynamically utilized part of the mammalian genomes

## Looking at transition between two closely related states
* Preimplanation epiblast - ESC
* postimplantation epiblast - EpiSC
FGF is major driving signal
## Came up with *in vitro* method of making EpiLC - unstable but more similar to *in vivo* state
### Used model to investigate differences in enchacers in naive and primed cells

## Oct4 undergoes major reorganization of occupancy ESC->EpiLC
## Enahcers (p300, k27ac, k4me1) also show cell-type specific reorganization
### Same Oct4 motif is recognized by ChIP and ChIP-exo in both cell types - no change in binding specificity
### TxN factor cooperativity/compeition => found differentially enriched motifs and MassSpec found similar set of candidates
### Changes in candidates correlated very highly with Oct4 changes => especially at enhancers
### Differentially occupied sites have changes in nucleosome occupancy by both DNAse and FAIRE-seq
