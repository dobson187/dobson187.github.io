<h1>Wysocka Q@: 0203</h1>

<h1>Enhancers are most dynamically utilized part of the mammalian genomes</h1>

<h2>Looking at transition between two closely related states</h2>

<ul>
<li>Preimplanation epiblast - ESC</li>
<li>postimplantation epiblast - EpiSC
FGF is major driving signal
<h2>Came up with <em>in vitro</em> method of making EpiLC - unstable but more similar to <em>in vivo</em> state</h2></li>
</ul>

<h3>Used model to investigate differences in enchacers in naive and primed cells</h3>

<h2>Oct4 undergoes major reorganization of occupancy ESC->EpiLC</h2>

<h2>Enahcers (p300, k27ac, k4me1) also show cell-type specific reorganization</h2>

<h3>Same Oct4 motif is recognized by ChIP and ChIP-exo in both cell types - no change in binding specificity</h3>

<h3>TxN factor cooperativity/compeition => found differentially enriched motifs and MassSpec found similar set of candidates</h3>

<h3>Changes in candidates correlated very highly with Oct4 changes => especially at enhancers</h3>

<h3>Differentially occupied sites have changes in nucleosome occupancy by both DNAse and FAIRE-seq</h3>
