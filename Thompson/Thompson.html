<h1>Thompson Q1: 0102</h1>

<h3>Link between metabolism (glucose/glutamine) and histone acetylation</h3>

<p>Studying IDH1 mutations in chromosomally normal AML</p>

<p>Phenotypic genes in AML are in heterochromatin [PcG/HP1]</p>

<p>nsSNV (missense) mutations in IDH1/2 are clustered in the active site</p>

<p>IDH1/2 mutations are mutually exclusive with TET2</p>

<p>2HG (rare metabolite) accumulation with mutant IDH &amp; inhibits TET2 &amp; jumonji
domain members</p>
