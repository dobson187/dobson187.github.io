### Link between metabolism (glucose/glutamine) and histone acetylation

Studying IDH1 mutations in chromosomally normal AML

Phenotypic genes in AML are in heterochromatin [PcG/HP1]

nsSNV (missense) mutations in IDH1/2 are clustered in the active site

IDH1/2 mutations are mutually exclusive with TET2

2HG (rare metabolite) accumulation with mutant IDH & inhibits TET2 & jumonji
domain members
