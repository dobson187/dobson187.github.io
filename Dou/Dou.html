<h4>Always a WT MLL1/MOF/WDR5 - is there a selection process?</h4>

<p>Yes. - Thiel et al., Cancer Cell (YEAR)</p>

<h3>All the MLL family members need ASH2L, RpBP5 and WDR5 - or do they?</h3>

<h3>Design a drug to inhibit MLL activity</h3>

<h4>Tried to co-crystalize MLL1 and rest of complex (unable to do it)</h4>

<h5>Does not require WDR5 for full methyltranserfase activity (only MLL1 not others)</h5>

<h5>Allows to devise a strategy to target only MLL1 and not the other MLLs</h5>

<h4>Designed a compound and a control</h4>

<h4>MM401 is a potent and highly specific binder to WDR5 central cavity</h4>

<h4>MM401 inhibits MLL1 and not other MLLs or global histone methylation</h4>

<h4>MM401 does inhibit MLL1-specific targets (HOX)</h4>

<h4>MM401 inhibits MLL leukemia</h4>

<h5>Cell line OeX HOXA, is resistant</h5>

<p>Get differentiation with drug
Induces apoptosis</p>

<h4>MLL1 activity is dispensable for bome marrow cell proliferation or colony formation</h4>

<h3>Transcriptome-wide study shows that MLL1 methyltransferase activity affects leukemia-related gene expression</h3>

<h3>WT and Mutant MLL1 promote activation and elongation, respectively in MLL</h3>
