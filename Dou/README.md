### Post-translational modification of histones

### H3K4me3 regulates important cellular processes

### MLL Family of H3 K4 Methylatransferases (hSet1)
WDR5, RpBP5, ASH2L, DPY30

* MLL3/4 Adip
* MLL2 germ and memory
* MLL1 hematopoeisis

#### MLL1 fusion protein in AML

Poor prognosis

* ENL
* AF4
* AF9
* AF6

#### Always a WT MLL1/MOF/WDR5 - is there a selection process?
Yes. - Thiel et al., Cancer Cell (YEAR)

### All the MLL family members need ASH2L, RpBP5 and WDR5 - or do they?

### Design a drug to inhibit MLL activity

#### Tried to co-crystalize MLL1 and rest of complex (unable to do it)
##### Does not require WDR5 for full methyltranserfase activity (only MLL1 not others)
##### Allows to devise a strategy to target only MLL1 and not the other MLLs

#### Designed a compound and a control

#### MM401 is a potent and highly specific binder to WDR5 central cavity

#### MM401 inhibits MLL1 and not other MLLs or global histone methylation

#### MM401 does inhibit MLL1-specific targets (HOX)

#### MM401 inhibits MLL leukemia
##### Cell line OeX HOXA, is resistant
Get differentiation with drug
Induces apoptosis

#### MLL1 activity is dispensable for bome marrow cell proliferation or colony formation

### Transcriptome-wide study shows that MLL1 methyltransferase activity affects leukemia-related gene expression

### WT and Mutant MLL1 promote activation and elongation, respectively in MLL
