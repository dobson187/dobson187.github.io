<h3>C/EBPa induces transdifferentiation by orchestrating distinct enhancer types</h3>

<h3>B-cells to macrophages transdifferentiation</h3>

<p>Cool live video of transdifferentiated cells that cluster together and then phagocytose labeled yeast cells in dish</p>

<h4>CEBPa immediately goes to enhancers for Pu.1 and Cebpb</h4>

<p>Important genes for phenotype</p>

<h4>Causes extensive chromatin remodeling at these enhancer sites</h4>

<h3>How is the B-cell transcription program extinguished?</h3>

<h4>Transient interactions that don't interfere with other TFs but actually co-activators causes reduced activation of a subset of superenhancers</h4>
