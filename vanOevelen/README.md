### C/EBPa induces transdifferentiation by orchestrating distinct enhancer types

### B-cells to macrophages transdifferentiation

Cool live video of transdifferentiated cells that cluster together and then phagocytose labeled yeast cells in dish

#### CEBPa immediately goes to enhancers for Pu.1 and Cebpb

Important genes for phenotype

#### Causes extensive chromatin remodeling at these enhancer sites

### How is the B-cell transcription program extinguished?

#### Transient interactions that don't interfere with other TFs but actually co-activators causes reduced activation of a subset of superenhancers
