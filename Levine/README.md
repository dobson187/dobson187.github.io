# Levine Q2: 0201

Early embryonic development

Paused polymerase - gro-seq

Snail regulates invagination of mesoderm

Synchronous expression of genes are controlled by level of paused Pol II read counts.

Used sna enhancer and minimal promoter elements

* Promoter            Pol II Read     Sync expression
1. SNAIL promoter   100             high
2. sog              50              med
3. ths              15              low

Showed a video of synchronous cell division - onset of gastrulation - flickering bursts of transcription - Weakly paused Thisbe promoter

* Average burst ~2-5 min, ~10-50 trans./burst

Strongly paused promoter (Snail) - "less bursty"

* More stable single - must less flickering

### Model: Paused Pol II Suppresses Bursting

Showed beautiful video of broad expression of eve stripe 2 being attenuated into a well-defined stripe at onset of gastrulation

### Model: Bursts foster dynamic repression of gene expression

Used MSL2 stem loop structure to control pausing

* Need more info on this - check paper

Appears to be a disconnect between observations and proposed mechanism
