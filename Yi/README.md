### Suppression of estrogen induced gene expression in breast cancer cells by the BET inhibitor JQ1

### ER stimulates the growth of ER-positive tumors

#### ER dimerize - nucleus - chromatin - recruit mediator, pcaf, p300, CARM1, etc.

### Focused on inhibiting readers of chromatin marks -> BET

#### BET family proteins are slightly more expressed in longer-lived patients

#### JQ1 inhibits ER-dependent MCF-7 proliferation

#### JQ1 globally attenuates ER-mediated gene regulation

#### BET family members are required to almost all ER-a enhancers

#### Knocked down BRD2,3,4 in permutations (only double or more had an effect) - suggests possible redundancy
