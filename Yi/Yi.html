<h3>Suppression of estrogen induced gene expression in breast cancer cells by the BET inhibitor JQ1</h3>

<h3>ER stimulates the growth of ER-positive tumors</h3>

<h4>ER dimerize - nucleus - chromatin - recruit mediator, pcaf, p300, CARM1, etc.</h4>

<h3>Focused on inhibiting readers of chromatin marks -> BET</h3>

<h4>BET family proteins are slightly more expressed in longer-lived patients</h4>

<h4>JQ1 inhibits ER-dependent MCF-7 proliferation</h4>

<h4>JQ1 globally attenuates ER-mediated gene regulation</h4>

<h4>BET family members are required to almost all ER-a enhancers</h4>

<h4>Knocked down BRD2,3,4 in permutations (only double or more had an effect) - suggests possible redundancy</h4>
