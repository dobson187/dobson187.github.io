<h1>RNA Polymerase II Pausing in Pluripotent Stem Cells</h1>

<h3>Unpublished data</h3>

<h2>NELF and P-TEFb are key regulators of pause duration</h2>

<h3>Work from John Lis</h3>

<ul>
<li>NELF inhibits early txn elongation</li>
<li>P-TEFb kin stim. diss. of NELF</li>
<li>NELF is "stupid" and goes everywhere with P2</li>
<li>P-TEFb can be modulated and controlled to release pausing</li>
</ul>

<h2>Most dros genes that have Pol II has promoter enrichment, which suggests there is pausing at most genes</h2>

<h2>Pausing index = promoter density / downstream density</h2>

<h2>Pausing is not an on/off switch - rather most of these genes are on at some level - leaky - not a good way to turn on/off more for attenuation</h2>

<h2>Genes paused were enriched in developmental genes (S2 cells)</h2>

<h2>Question: how to define where NELF-mediated pausing is functionally important?</h2>

<h3>Pausing plays an important role in preventing nucleosomes from forming - absence of NELF => increased nucleosome formation</h3>

<h2>Dual functions of pausing</h2>

<ul>
<li>Limits P2 release</li>
<li>Prevents promoter nucleosome assembly</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is the role in mammalian development?</h2>

<h2>Bivalent and dev. genes are not enriched with PP2</h2>

<h3>Some genes have it but not different than genomic average</h3>

<h3>What genes are pausing - what is unique about them?</h3>

<h3>Signaling cascades that regulate development</h3>

<h3>Some downstream targets had pausing - but not necessary or required for rapid activation</h3>

<h2>Generated conditional NELF-B KO mouse</h2>

<h3>Null is lethal - NELF is essential - PI lethality</h3>

<h3>Moved to tamoxifen CRE</h3>

<h3>Loss of NELF-B results in degradation of the other subunits</h3>

<h3>Did microarray immediately after NELF was depleted - early target identification 1000 genes</h3>

<h4>Genes involved in lineage com. and pluri. not affected</h4>

<h4>Mapk/Erk signaling was affected</h4>

<h4>Erk/Mapk signaling activates exit from true naive pluri state</h4>

<h4>2i media inhibits Map/Erk to maintain a more naive state</h4>

<h4>Two effects</h4>

<ul>
<li>Increased pol2 processing into gene body  =>  upregulation</li>
<li>lack of Pol II at promoter                =>  downregulation
<h4>Cells fail to differentiate as indicated by the endoderm marker GATA4</h4></li>
</ul>

<h4>FGF doesn't phos ERK - broad dampening of pathway</h4>

<h4>Can rescue with a fusion of Erk2Mek1 with NLS => get GATA4 expression +/- NELF-b</h4>
