# RNA Polymerase II Pausing in Pluripotent Stem Cells
### Unpublished data

## NELF and P-TEFb are key regulators of pause duration
### Work from John Lis
* NELF inhibits early txn elongation
* P-TEFb kin stim. diss. of NELF
* NELF is "stupid" and goes everywhere with P2
* P-TEFb can be modulated and controlled to release pausing

## Most dros genes that have Pol II has promoter enrichment, which suggests there is pausing at most genes

## Pausing index = promoter density / downstream density

## Pausing is not an on/off switch - rather most of these genes are on at some level - leaky - not a good way to turn on/off more for attenuation

## Genes paused were enriched in developmental genes (S2 cells)

## Question: how to define where NELF-mediated pausing is functionally important?
### Pausing plays an important role in preventing nucleosomes from forming - absence of NELF => increased nucleosome formation

## Dual functions of pausing
* Limits P2 release
* Prevents promoter nucleosome assembly


## What is the role in mammalian development?

## Bivalent and dev. genes are not enriched with PP2
### Some genes have it but not different than genomic average 
### What genes are pausing - what is unique about them?
### Signaling cascades that regulate development
### Some downstream targets had pausing - but not necessary or required for rapid activation

## Generated conditional NELF-B KO mouse
### Null is lethal - NELF is essential - PI lethality
### Moved to tamoxifen CRE
### Loss of NELF-B results in degradation of the other subunits
### Did microarray immediately after NELF was depleted - early target identification 1000 genes
#### Genes involved in lineage com. and pluri. not affected
#### Mapk/Erk signaling was affected
#### Erk/Mapk signaling activates exit from true naive pluri state
#### 2i media inhibits Map/Erk to maintain a more naive state
#### Two effects
* Increased pol2 processing into gene body  =>  upregulation
* lack of Pol II at promoter                =>  downregulation
#### Cells fail to differentiate as indicated by the endoderm marker GATA4
#### FGF doesn't phos ERK - broad dampening of pathway
#### Can rescue with a fusion of Erk2Mek1 with NLS => get GATA4 expression +/- NELF-b
