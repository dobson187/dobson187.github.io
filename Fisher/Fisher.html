<h3>Human X chromosome reactivation mediated by cell fusion reprogramming</h3>

<p>One X chromosome is inactive in diploid female somatic cells</p>

<ul>
<li>Xi is randomly chosen - multiple levels of epigenetic maintenance</li>
<li>Inactivation is inherited</li>
</ul>

<h4>X reactivation correlates with the establishment of pluripotency</h4>

<p>Focus will be on X reactivation - not on random inactivation</p>

<h5>Shows Guttman/Engreitz paper and discusses 3D spreading</h5>

<h4>Need to remove multiple levels of repression (Xist, Histone repression, etc.)</h4>

<h5>Shows Nathans/Wu paper - mosaicism</h5>

<h3>Focus on reprogramming by cell fusion</h3>

<h4>Fuse human B-lymphocytes with mES using PEG</h4>

<p>Oct4 translocates into the human somatic nucleus</p>

<p>Rapid induction of pluripotent gene expression program</p>

<h4>Xist is delocalized upon reprogramming</h4>

<h4>H3K27me3 enrichment on the Xi is lost during reprogramming</h4>

<h4>Onset of bi-allelic expression in about 1/3 of cells</h4>

<h3>What is the extent of X chromosome reactivation?</h3>

<p>Derived clonal populations of defined X being inactive</p>

<p>Used SNPs to confirm and differentiate alleles</p>

<p>Needed extremely deep RNA-seq sequencing to map alleles</p>

<p>Saw a surprisingly high degree of escapers (genes expressed before fusion)</p>

<h4>Hypothesizes that Oct4 and Nanog are driving reactivation</h4>
