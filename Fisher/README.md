### Human X chromosome reactivation mediated by cell fusion reprogramming

One X chromosome is inactive in diploid female somatic cells

* Xi is randomly chosen - multiple levels of epigenetic maintenance
* Inactivation is inherited

#### X reactivation correlates with the establishment of pluripotency

Focus will be on X reactivation - not on random inactivation

##### Shows Guttman/Engreitz paper and discusses 3D spreading

#### Need to remove multiple levels of repression (Xist, Histone repression, etc.)

##### Shows Nathans/Wu paper - mosaicism

### Focus on reprogramming by cell fusion

#### Fuse human B-lymphocytes with mES using PEG

Oct4 translocates into the human somatic nucleus

Rapid induction of pluripotent gene expression program

#### Xist is delocalized upon reprogramming

#### H3K27me3 enrichment on the Xi is lost during reprogramming

#### Onset of bi-allelic expression in about 1/3 of cells

### What is the extent of X chromosome reactivation?

Derived clonal populations of defined X being inactive

Used SNPs to confirm and differentiate alleles

Needed extremely deep RNA-seq sequencing to map alleles

Saw a surprisingly high degree of escapers (genes expressed before fusion)

#### Hypothesizes that Oct4 and Nanog are driving reactivation
