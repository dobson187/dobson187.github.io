### Topologically associated domains: cell type and cell cycle specific interactions

#### Organization of 3D genome controls gene regulatory dynamics

#### Interphase chromosomes are compartmentalized (active/inactive)
1. Compartment A
2. Compartment B

#### Gene regulation happens within these defined topological domains

##### Used 5C to model this because you only need about 10mil read to get to restriction enzyme resolution for 5Mb region

#### TAD domain boundaries are consistent between cell lines

#### Internally (within TAD boundaries) there can be reorganization within TADs

##### Show cell-type specific enhancer-promoter interactions

### Genes are spatially restricted to their TAD

### TADs are universal structural building blocks within wich cell-type specific looping is constrained

### Cell cycle dependent chromosome conformation?

#### During mitosis the interaction map is "boring" - very uniform map

### Mitotic chromosomes: no compartments

#### Mitotic chromosome folding:

1. no locus-specific structures
2. long-range interactions up to 10Mb

#### Two models:

1. polymer model
2. laemmeli scaffold model

#### Testing polymer model of mitotic chromosomes

1. polymer (hierarchical model) was not consistent with chromatin interaction map
2. Laemmeli array loop model reproduce chromatin interaction map (loops 80-120Kb)

#### Stochastic loop positions are necessary - can't be fixed - each cell in population has different anchors
